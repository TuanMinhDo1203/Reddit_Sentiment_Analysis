That ones easy and happens in almost every team post sacking - They know Amorim is looking to settle on a starting 11 and want to be in and not out of it. Give it till March when UTD are struggling to make the CL and you'll see lot of players being described as lazy.
Saw it with Mou, with Solskjaer and with Ten Hag himself

1he8fsc,m223i76,"On the offside thing, taking it back, I do sometimes internally debate and I have done since that Coventry v Man U FA Cup game. I think the “spirit” of the offside rule isn’t meant to rule out insanely tight offsides to the point of centimetres or whatever, but the literal application we get thanks to VAR is any offside is a breach, so stands. A linesman, due to the fact they work in the naked eye, likely wouldn’t call offside on some of the super tight margins VAR calls, which in my view is technically more in the “spirit” of the law as it should be obvious advantage. But, also a linesman will sometimes make a massive error, because they aren’t a computer. My internal debate is, am I willing to accept the odd glaring error for the sake of the “spirit” of the offside law, or would I rather the law applied as technically as possible to the point of the finest of margins for the sake of avoiding the possibility of glaring errors?

Gibbs-White has turned it over far too easily several times and I'd happily see him subbed off but I said that last weekend too.

Also missing one foul does not give you carte blanche to ignore the next more serious infraction,  that would be a fucking degenerate refereeing standard.

Still slightly annoyed Tottenham bums gave two pens b gifted Chelsea the win that game . Liverpool look really good but individual errors /luck or great opposition finishing has led two draws in games we could’ve won n shoukdvd by the data .

They’re 7 points over expected which is enormous , other teams aren’t finishing chances they ought to , many wins n results you guys have gotten are down to that ( despite everything Tottenham and even Brentford n last few games you won on less expected differential in goals then liverpools two draws, in fact you ought to have lost or drawn Tottenham at best n it was an epic collapse by them)

I’m not saying this to be a downer . But as a Liverpool fan often when we’ve been flying n leading the league these tables had us over performing expected points . And it caught up to us ultimately. Palmer is worth a couple points extra due to his finishing I think but outsude that a lot of your other guys I don’t think are outlier finishers .

Maybe you’ll keep this up but watching you guys play it really feels like watching Us( Liverpool) last year where we eventually fell off n couldn’t get away with conceding so much .

I remember Kane used to be like that and he started dropping deep and learning how to use his skills to unlock the wings and move the play forward.

He stood on Schar twice. 
He had a chance to push off one leg and just fall to the side. Instead he tries to stay on his own feet, which is the wrong decision as his lack of balance makes him stand on Schar. 

IF it was intentional, which can be argued as he was looking the whole time and chose to stand on him rather than falling to either side, its a red for violent conduct.

Well it's easy to say in hindsight but throw your weight forward a bit and you fall more horizontally rather than trying to stay standing, he lost his balance so falling forward is really the only way he avoids contact but regardless it doesn't really matter because he can still hurt the opponent accidently and it still would be a red.

Like I'll be the first to say I'd hate if it was a red given against a Newcastle player but the rules say:

> A tackle or challenge that endangers the safety of an opponent or uses excessive force or brutality must be sanctioned as serious foul play.

>Violent conduct is when a player uses or attempts to use excessive force or brutality against an opponent when not challenging for the ball, or against a team-mate, team official, match official, spectator or any other person, regardless of whether contact is made.

It doesn't say anything about intention at all just that it endangers the opponent, so like you can accidently seriously injure someone in the field of play.",FlukyS,1,2024-12-26 17:27:29,t1_m3wegig

It doesn't say intent specifically but it does say it requires excessive force or brutality. Is anyone actually arguing falling onto someone fits either of those? In that sense, intent is important because intent dictates whether the force was excessive or not. If he had stomped on him it wouldve been, but because he tried not to but couldn't help it through no fault of his own, I cant see how that can be called excessive.

>Well it's easy to say in hindsight but throw your weight forward a bit and you fall more horizontally rather than trying to stay standing, he lost his balance so falling forward is really the only way he avoids contact

Maybe but like I said, Schar kicked his groin first and then he twisted his ankle and fell backwards. He didnt even get to choose the way he fell really. I just think jts clear he did his very best not to land on Schar, which should be commended not punished with a red. Whereas Schar deliberatelt stuck his legs up to stud Duran, is that not brutal moreso?

Besides, think we agree reds should serve a purpose. To discourage bad behaviour. What does this discourage? Falling? I say again, next time stand on his back why not.",Chalkun,1,2024-12-26 17:39:37,t1_m3wg3rg

I think this higlights the situation the best. In football, i have no knowledge about the actual rule so just speculating, the action is the only thing judged. Intent is not part of the way moves are judged. If it was, players with best intentions sometimes miss a tackle and actually commit card worthy fouls. If we are gonna put this much importance on intent, then it should also apply to mistimed tackles and it will open another can of worm.

Start both clocks at the same time.

A unit of time measurement meaning one thousandth of a second.

>if you curve a pass is going to add 3 milliseconds and 5% more offside goals because you nudged the ball a little more?

Irrelevant since an offside position is determined at the moment the ball is played and not received. 

>do they go by when the impact was made or when theres no more contact between foot and ball?

former.


>Why did they invent offsides in the first place??

[To prevent 'goal hanging'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)).  Meaning someone just waiting by the opposition goal and waiting for the ball to be launched at them.",roguedevil,2,2024-12-27 20:53:32,t1_m435d1x
1hnn04h,m431f4d,"A lot of people don’t remember, or weren’t around, before we had VAR. the amount of incorrect decisions that happened week in week out was crazy with both offside goals been given and onside goals being disallowed. 

The argument of being tight is irrelevant when Brighton are using a high line as part of their defensive strategy. Catching forwards offside is their game plan and a legitimate one that only works with the rules as they are now. 

VAR gets a lot wrong and it can be annoying as fuck sometimes, like yesterday taking 3 and a half minutes to check both Liverpool goals, one given, one disallowed correctly. But offside is the one objective thing it can get right every time.

They're prioritising control so much that their games are just so dull these days. 

Look at Gakpo's goal yesterday vs Leicester, Liverpool went from Allison to Gakpo in about 4 passes right after a Leicester attack.

1hnnrt4,m43fb7a,"One of Arsenal’s most prominent partnerships has been with Emirates, a deal that has been worth around £700m million over several years, contributing to concerns about the UAE’s human rights record and the notion of sportswashing. Additionally, the club has entered into agreements with betting companies, including a partnership with 888Sport, which reportedly paid around £10 million annually, despite growing scrutiny over the gambling industry’s impact on football. Another controversial deal was with the Rwandan government, which sponsored Arsenal’s shirt sleeve for £30 million as part of a broader marketing campaign to improve the country’s image.

Nuno was battling relegation at the end of last season with Forest being brought in in the middle of the season, and losing far more games then he drew or won. With a good preseason he has turned Forest into a team that plays his way and they’re now smashing it. INEOS hiring a coach mid season who plays a completely different system than the previous coach, and giving him a squad low on confidence, quality and built around the system of that previous coach is on them - either hire a coach who will be able to step in and pick up the reins straight away, or you have to stomach the uncomfortable shift in the middle of a season when you’re already low in the table.",TheGent_88,15,2024-12-30 20:42:10,t3_1hpvtd9

I didn't make the rules.",symptic,5,2025-01-01 19:20:56,t1_m4w1ott
1hr7kdb,m4w376n,"Official answer

* What part of the bodies are involved. Push in the back is bad, using hands to push generally bad, shoulder to shoulder is ideal.
* Force used. Fairly obvious but referees should use judgement on how big a push it was and if it was really enough to send a player to the ground.
* Who has possession. If it's unclear who has the ball then competing for the ball will generally be allowed more than if you are going into someone that already has control.

Unofficially (at least as far as I know in the rules)

* Position on the pitch. This is absolutely massive, you can't compare a push on a defender in their own half (easy to give free kicks) to a push on a striker in or near the box (very difficult to give unless it's particularly blatant). They may as well have different rulesets for how they are treated.",goonerh1,4,2025-01-01 19:26:33,t1_m4w1ott
